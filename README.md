# Plastweet
_A small plasmoid to tweet directly from your Plasma desktop (WiP)_

The primary goal of this project is to bring the ability to quickly send tweets without opening your browser or any other program. It aims to be as simple and lightweight as possible.

## Features
Currently, posting tweet updates is the only available function. Although UI for adding images and videos is already there, it doesn't actually work with the JavaScript implementation (I'm working on it!).
However, you still can get this feature if you clone and compile the previous version (check the `cxx-backend` branch), but keep in mind that it requires additional dependencies and to be compiled.

## Installation
### User
Copy or move the `package` directory inside `src` to `~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids` (create the appropriate directories as needed).

### System-wide
Open a terminal in the cloned directory and run:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DKDE_INSTALL_USE_QT_SYS_PATHS=ON
make
sudo make install
```
